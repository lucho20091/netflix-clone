# Your rule content

- We are using React and tailwind
- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to
- If its JSX add comment to the end of the code html structure

for explaining structure do like html format for example
<div>
<{html element} = {his function on the code}>
   <{html element} = {his function on the code}>

- I also want you to list all the css code that has been used in that JSX file
text-white = color: white;
{tailwind css className} = {css property: css value}
